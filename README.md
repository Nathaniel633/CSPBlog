## Project and Objective
> For Student as a repository

My Student repository is a clone of the nighthawkcoders' student repository. This repository was mainly used for planning projects, creating personal contributions to group projects, personal projects, and fun little side projects, as well as the use of the notebook feature to document my projects and learning in this course with weekly plans. Later on in the course, we used utterances to peer grade and offer feedback to each other prior to teacher review. We also took advantage of github issues to create writeups for certain projects, showcasing the process of planning a project, the development process, all the way to the deployment and live site. In this repository you'll find a collection of the projects that I've worked on which taking the AP Computer Science Principles course at Del Norte and working with a variety of groupmates.

## Usage
> The intended use of my repository

As it is primarily notebook based, my project can be used to view my work in this course and how I progressed as a coder and programmer, from creating a functioning timer with a visualizer that I partially copied off the web, to creating a fully functioning gymnastics judger that I apply to my gymnastics training to make my training more efficiently. You can view my site as a timeline as I have it organized through weeks throughout the 36 weeks of the school year. You can also look at the image I created on the first day of school about myself, and through my account system, you can have a personalized experience.

## Projects
> The specific projects I've worked on during AP Computer Science Principles course and Data Structures

- Scheduling App: An app designed to help students better manage their schedules. Taking input, users can add events to their schedules as well as mark them complete when done. We also incomporated a pomodoro timer to better manage "study time" by creating intervals of 25 minute study periods broken by 5 minute breaks. Our group member Aidan Lau added Canvas API for us to be able to see our personal schedules updated based on what our teachers assign.

- Turn-based Fantasy Game: This game follows a character along a gameboard of 9 spots as they have to fight an enemy. The enemy is invisible and follows a random path until the character meets the enemy on the square, to which the character has to guess a randomized number to beat the enemy. There are 5 character classes, and each class determines the aesthetic of the game board, as well as the stats of the character. The number of wins are then attached to the user and displayed in a leaderboard.

- Gymnastics Judging Assistant: This program was a personal program of mine to meet the requirements for the Create Performance Task portion of the AP Computer Science Principles AP exam. In the process of brainstorming, I knew I wanted to create a program that would benefit my life, but specific enough that there wouldn't be another program like it submitted. My love for gymnastics propelled me to create this program as it makes the manual process of judging a gymnastics routine and digitizing it. With buttons, the judge can judge both execution and difficulty more quickly and efficiently. At the end, you click a button and the final score is displayed. You can then store that score in an array based on the gymnast and the event.

- Movie Sentiment Analizer: This project was created for our Machine Learning demo, however I used ChatGPT API to perform it. This project takes input of a movie review and outputs the sentiment; either good, bad, or neutral. Doing this, we prompted GPT to receive input of the review and to report a one word answer.

## Contributors
> Other people I have collaborated with (not directly contributing to this repository)

This course is highly structured around groupwork, so this year I have gotten used to working with a number of different people. The following people are those of whom I've directly collaborated with during this school year: Rayyan Darugar, Daniel Choi, Aidan Lau, Will Bartelt, Grayson Guyot, Jason Gao, Arushi Pandley, Ellie Rozenkrants, Anusha Khobare, Ananya Asudani, and Cindy Liang.
