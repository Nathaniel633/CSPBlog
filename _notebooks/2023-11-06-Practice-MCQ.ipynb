    "This problem required some thinking as I immediately noticed a difference but didn't know how the difference affected the result. As I further analyzed each function, it seemed as though one took the average of the whole list, while the other took the average of the list after each value in the list. The first function would have more arithmetic steps, but both would achieve the same result.\n",

    "This question offered some thought as I had to figure out the best way to calculate the final score based on the algorithm in words. This question wasn't too challenging, but was a fun brain puzzle as I had to figure out why the others didn't work and why B was the most proper answer. To solve it, I need to find the hgiher score between the final and the midterm, and add that to the final exam score, because if the final exam score was higher than the midterm, it replaces the score.\n",

    "This question felt more like a word-logic problem, as it was more difficult to discern what exactly the question was asking. It took a bit to understand but with the random number being less than 75 out of 100, that will happen 75% of the time, giving us the result we wanted.\n",

    "This question was interesting, as I was quick to rule out B, because determining the average amount of days students were absent would have no purpose, but I was stuck between the last two, but I think finding out the most prevalent zip code would be more important to a school than determining the student with the most number of absences.\n",

    "This MC took me roughly 1 and a half hours to complete and I got a score of 54/66, but the MC questions were mostly very easy to figure out with just a little bit of thought. I highlighted above the ones that either took me the longest, or were the most interesting/fascinating to me, or were just a fun challenge to complete that I wanted to share my thought process of. I feel as though this MC did help me a lot with my understanding of pseudocode and helped boost my confidence for the AP test in March."
