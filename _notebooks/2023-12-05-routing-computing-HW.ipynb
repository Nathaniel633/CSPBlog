    "> Question 1: What is parallel computing?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parallel computing is a type of computation in which many calculations or processes are carried out simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Question 2: If there is a computer with 3 cores that can each take one task, and the tasks are 25ms, 632ms and 100ms in run time respectively, how long will the program take to run?\n",
    "\n",
    "- 632ms\n",
    "\n",
    "> Question 3: Is sequential or parallel computing more efficient, and why?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parallel computing is more efficient as it has the ability to divide workload among different cores or processors running simultaneously, getting the job done a lot quicker than if they were completed one after the other\n",
    "\n",
    "> Question 4: What is the term called when a network has multiple paths leading up to one destination? (Used in fault-tolerant systems)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Redundant routing\n",
    "\n",
    "> Question 5: Using the image above, is this fault tolerant?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Yes, this is fault tolerant, as if you cut any strand, all strands all still connected"
