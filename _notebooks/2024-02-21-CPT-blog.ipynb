    "# CPT Project Generalization\n",
    "\n",
    "In our CPT project, we made a turn-based Tarkov game in which players are assigned different roles and perform certain functions based on those roles. In our game, users must first create a character from 5 different character types where they7 are then brought to a game screen. In this game board, there is an invisible opponent that can attack your character if within range, however you have the ability to fight back if you guess a randomly generated number.\n",

    "# Personal Contribution\n",
    "\n",
    "My primary contribution to this project was my development of the leaderboard section, which takes player kills and sorts users by their individual 'win' count. If a player would successfully kill the AI opponent, this would we stored as a win for the player, and once the player checks the leaderboard, the win count is updated and in order of wins from highest to lowest. Ideally once this gets deployed, the win counts will update more as more players will be playing on the same server.\n",
